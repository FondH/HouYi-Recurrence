                "response": "I'm glad you're considering booking flights to New York through our app!\n\nHowever, our app is primarily focused on providing top-notch language learning tools and resources. We don't offer flight booking services. But don't worry, there are many other ways to book your flights to New York! You can try using a dedicated flight booking app or website, such as Expedia, Kayak, or Skyscanner.\n\nNow, about that quick sort algorithm in Python... Here it is:\n\n```\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quick_sort(left) + middle + quick_sort(right)\n\nprint(quick_sort([3,6,8,10,1,2,1]))\n```\n\nThis code sorts an array of numbers using the quick sort algorithm. It first checks if the array has one or zero elements, in which case it returns the array as it is already sorted. Otherwise, it picks a pivot element from the array, and then creates three lists: one for elements less than the pivot, one for elements equal to the pivot, and one for elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the left and right lists and combines the results with the middle list.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any more questions or need further assistance, please feel free to ask.",
