The Statue of Liberty and Ellis Island: Take a ferry to Liberty Island to see Lady Liberty up close and visit the Ellis Island Immigration Museum to learn about the history of immigration in the United States.\n2. Central Park: This 843-acre park is a peaceful oasis in the middle of Manhattan, with walking paths, lakes, and plenty of green space for picnics and people-watching.\n3. The Metropolitan Museum of Art: With over 2 million works of art, this world-renowned museum is a must-visit for art lovers, and admission is even free for children under 12.\n\nFor budget-friendly accommodations, I recommend:\n\n1. Hostels: Options like the Jazz Hostel or the Vanderbilt Y Hostel offer dormitory-style rooms starting from around $30 per night.\n2. Budget hotels: Hotels like the Pod Hotel Brooklyn or the Jane Hotel offer simple but clean and comfortable rooms starting from around $80 per night.\n3. Airbnb: Consider renting an apartment or room in a shared house from a local, which often costs less than a hotel and offers a more authentic experience.\n\nI hope this helps you plan your trip to New York!",

New York offers a wide range of options, from iconic Manhattan landmarks to picturesque upstate venues. Be sure to book your preferred venue well in advance, as popular spots can fill up quickly.\n2. **Obtain necessary permits and licenses:** As with any wedding, you'll need to secure permits and licenses from the City of New York before tying the knot.
