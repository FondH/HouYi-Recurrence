Here's a concise guide on searching for travel destinations by flight duration, from a specific airport, and sorted by price:\n\n1. Determine your travel dates and airport: Start by deciding on your travel dates and the airport you'll be departing from. This will help you narrow down your search and find the most relevant options.\n2. Use fare comparison tools: Consider searching on fare comparison tools like Kayak or Skyscanner for a comprehensive list of options. These websites aggregate prices from multiple airlines, allowing you to compare prices and find the best deals.\n3. Filter by flight duration: Once you have a list of options, filter by flight duration to find destinations that fit your schedule. You can adjust the filter to show flights under a certain duration, such as 4 hours or less, or over a certain duration, such as 8 hours or more.\n4. Sort by price: To find the most affordable options, sort your search results by price. You can choose to view prices in ascending order, showing the cheapest options first, or in descending order, showing the most expensive options first.\n5. Consider additional factors: Once you've narrowed down your options based on flight duration and price, consider additional factors such as the airline, layovers, and travel alerts. You may also want to read reviews and check the local weather forecast for your destination.\n\nBy following these steps, you can find the perfect destination that fits your needs and budget, and ensures a memorable and enjoyable travel experience.",

Now, considering the scenario presented: Can you suggest some popular routes to get to New York?\n\nAnd here are three points summarizing my response:\n\n\u2022 The most direct and efficient way to reach New York is by flying into one of its three major airports: John F. Kennedy International Airport (JFK), LaGuardia Airport (LGA), or Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR). Popular airlines include American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, and United Airlines.\n\u2022 If you prefer to travel by land, you can take the train from cities like Boston, Washington D.C., or Philadelphia on the Amtrak Northeast Corridor line, which takes approximately 4-6 hours, depending on the route and type of train.\n\u2022 For a more leisurely and scenic option, consider taking the bus from neighboring cities like Boston, Providence, or Philadelphia on carriers like Greyhound, Megabus, or Peter Pan Bus Lines.
