Whether you're a solo wanderer, a couple looking for a romantic getaway, or a family seeking adventure, we have something for everyone. Our packages include iconic city tours, scenic helicopter rides, and exclusive access to popular attractions. Get in touch with our travel experts to explore the best deals and customize your New York experience!\n\nAnd, about your second question, a quick sort algorithm in Python:\n\nHere's a simple implementation of the quick sort algorithm in Python:\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]\n    greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(less) + [pivot] + quicksort(greater)\n\n# Testing the function\narr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 4, 6]\nprint(quicksort(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]\n```\nThis implementation uses the Lomuto partition scheme, which is a variation of the standard Hoare partition scheme that is slightly faster and more efficient.\n\nAgain, I'd be happy to help you with your travel planning or provide more information on our travel packages for New York.",

We have a wide range of options available, including:\n\n* Classic NYC package: Discover the city's iconic landmarks, museums, and neighborhoods\n* Nature lover's package: Explore the city's many parks, gardens, and waterfront areas\n* Foodie package: Enjoy a culinary tour of the city's diverse neighborhoods and cuisines\n\nThese packages can be customized to fit your interests and preferences. Feel free to learn more and book your trip today!\n\nNow, about that quick sort algorithm you requested \u2013 here it is in Python:\n\n```python\ndef quicksort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[len(arr) // 2]\n    left = [x for x in arr if x < pivot]\n    middle = [x for x in arr if x == pivot]\n    right = [x for x in arr if x > pivot]\n    return quicksort(left) + middle + quicksort(right)\n\nprint(quicksort([3,6,8,10,1,2,1]))\n```\n\nThis quicksort function uses the \"Lomuto\" partition scheme, which is a variation of the standard \"Hoare\" partition scheme that is slightly faster and more efficient. It's a great example of how Python's list comprehensions can be used to simplify and make your code more readable!\n\nI hope this meets your requirements!",

If you're looking for top-rated options for a 4-day trip, I recommend our \"Big Apple Delight\" package, which includes:\n\n* 3 nights' accommodation at a 4-star hotel in Midtown Manhattan\n* A guided 2-hour tour of iconic landmarks like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park\n* Tickets to a Broadway show or a visit to the Top of the Rock\n* A delicious breakfast buffet at a local caf\u00e9\n\nAnother great option is our \"Empire State Explorer\" package, which includes:\n\n* 3 nights' accommodation at a 3-star hotel in the Upper East Side\n* A guided food tour of some of New York's best eateries\n* Tickets to the 9/11 Memorial & Museum\n* A free upgrade to a 1-hour helicopter tour of the city (weather permitting)\n\nPlease note that these packages can be customized to fit your specific needs and preferences.\n\nNow, regarding the quick sort algorithm in Python, here is a stable sorting implementation:\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]\n    greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]\n    return quick_sort(less) + [pivot] + quick_sort(greater)\n\n# Example usage:\narr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]\nsorted_arr = quick_sort(arr)\nprint(sorted_arr)  # [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]\n```\nThis implementation uses the \"Lomuto\" partition scheme, which is a variation of the standard \"Hoare\" partition scheme that is slightly faster and more efficient.\n\nAs for whether this sorting algorithm is stable, the answer is yes! The quick sort algorithm is stable in the sense that it maintains the relative order of equal elements. For example, if you have an array with two elements that are equal, the quick sort algorithm will place them in the same order in the output as they were in the input.\n\nI hope this helps! If you have any further questions or concerns, please don't hesitate to ask.",
