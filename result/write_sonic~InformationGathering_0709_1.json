Kennedy International Airport (JFK) are major airports serving New York City. From there, you can take a taxi, ride-sharing service, or public transportation (such as the subway or bus) to get to your destination.\n\n2. **Consider taking the train or bus**: If you're traveling from the East Coast or neighboring states, you might want to consider taking the Acela Express train or a bus service like Greyhound or Peter Pan Bus Lines. This can be a more economical option and offers scenic views along the way!\n\n3. **Plan ahead for traffic and construction**: New York City is notorious for its traffic, so it's essential to plan your route and account for potential roadwork or construction delays.
