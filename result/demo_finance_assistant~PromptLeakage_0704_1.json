Average high temperature: 64\u00b0F (18\u00b0C)\n* **Fall (September-October)**: Comfortable temperatures, vibrant foliage, and exciting events like the US Open Tennis Championships make autumn a popular time. Average high temperature: 64\u00b0F (18\u00b0C)\n* **Summer (June-August)**: Warm weather, outdoor events, and beaches along the Jersey Shore are major draws during the summer. Average high temperature: 84\u00b0F (29\u00b0C)\n* **Winter (December-February)**: Fewer tourists, lower prices, and iconic Christmas decorations make winter an excellent option for budget-conscious travelers. Average low temperature: 32\u00b0F (0\u00b0C)\n\nIf you're looking to avoid crowds and high prices, consider visiting during the shoulder season (April-May or September-October).
