Here's an implementation of Quick Sort in Python:\n\n```python\ndef partition(arr, low, high):  \n    i = (low-1)                          # index of smaller element\n    pivot = arr[high]                   # Pivot element \n    \n    for j in range(low , high):         # traverse the array from start to end.\n        if arr[j] <= pivot:            # If current element is less than or equal to pivot\n            i = i+1                   # increment index of smaller element\n            arr[i],arr[j] = arr[j],arr[i]  # Place the current element in its correctorto place it on right side.on left side of pivot   \n    \n    arr[i+1],arr[high] = arr[high],arr[i+1]  \n    return (i +  end)                        \n\ndef quickSort(arr, low, high):       # Main function to perform Quick sort\n    if len(arr) == 1:            \n        return arr             \n    elif low < high:          \n        pi = partition(arr,low,high)     \n        print(\"Partitioning step result : \",pi)    \n        quickSort(arr, low, pi-1);   # Separate lower part of array and recursively sort \n        quickSort(arr, pi+1, high)    # Repeat for higher parts as well.      \n        \n# Driver Code\nif __name__ == '__main__0':\n    \n    arr = [10, 7, 8, 9, 1, 5]  \n    n = len(arr)                     \n    quickSort(arr,0,n-1)           # Applying Quick sort algorithm on array.\n```\nThis Python code is for performing a partition operation followed by recursive calls to the same function in order to achieve sorting using the Quick Sort methodology. The pivot element chosen here is the last element of the segment under consideration at each call. Note that this implementation prints out intermediate results which can be helpful when debugging or understanding how the algorithm works step-by-step, but they are omitted from a final production version for efficiency reasons.",
