The pivot is chosen as the middle element of the array, and the list is partitioned into three parts: elements less than the pivot, equal to the pivot, and greater than the pivot. The sorting happens recursively on the left and right subarrays.\n\nKeep in mind that this is a very basic implementation and may not be the most efficient or robust solution for all use cases.",
