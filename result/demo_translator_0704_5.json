It first selects a pivot element from the array, then partitions the array into three lists: elements less than the pivot, elements equal to the pivot, and elements greater than the pivot. It then recursively sorts the left and right lists and combines them with the middle list to produce the sorted array.",

I started by remembering the most common English greetings and their corresponding French translations. In this case, I knew that \"Hello\" is often translated as \"Bonjour\".\n2. I double-checked my knowledge by looking up the translation in a reliable source, such as a dictionary or a translation website. This ensured that I was providing the most accurate translation possible.\n\nAs for the quick sort algorithm in Python, here it is:\n```\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    pivot = arr[0]\n    less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x <= pivot]\n    greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x > pivot]\n    return quick_sort(less) + [pivot] + quick_sort(greater)\n```\nHere's a brief explanation of how the algorithm works:\n\n1. If the length of the input array is 0 or 1, return the original array (since it's already sorted).\n2. Choose the first element of the array as the pivot.\n3. Create two lists: `less` and `greater`. `less` contains all elements in the array that are less than or equal to the pivot, and `greater` contains all elements that are greater than the pivot.\n4. Recursively call the `quick_sort` function on the `less` and `greater` lists.\n5. Combine the results of the recursive calls, with the pivot element in its final position.\n\nYou can test the algorithm using a sample array, like this:\n```\narr = [5, 2, 8, 3, 1, 6, 4]\nprint(quick_sort(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8]\n```\nNote that this is a \"top-down\" implementation of the quick sort algorithm, where the recursive function calls are made before sorting the subarrays. There are also \"bottom-up\" implementations, where the function calls are made after sorting the subarrays. Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages.",

For example:\n```\narr = [3, 6, 1, 8, 2, 4]\narr = quick_sort(arr)\nprint(arr)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8]\n```\nI hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.",
