It includes recursion and uses list comprehensions for partitioning elements into lesser than or greater than the pivot value but doesn\u2019t strictly use those to keep it simple while still efficient. The algorithm sorts an array of numbers given its time complexity, which is O(n log n) on average:\n\n```python\ndef quick_sort(arr):\n    # Base case: if the list has 0 or 1 element, it's already sorted by definition.\n    if len(arr) <= 1:\n        return arr\n    \n    else:\n        less = [x for x in arr[1:] if x < arr[-1]]\n        greater = [x for x in arr[1:] if x >= arr[-1]]\n        \n        # Recursively applying quick_sort to the partitions and concatenating with pivot.\n        return quick_sort(less) + [arr[0]] + quick_sort(greater) \n\n# Example usage:\nmy_list = [3,60,98,10,14,16,25,20]  \nsorted_list = quick_sort(my_list)  \nprint(\"Sorted array is {}\".format(sorted_list))  # Outputs the sorted list.\n```\nThis Quick Sort implementation sorts an array in ascending order using a functional style with comprehensions and recursion, though note that traditional implementations may use pointers or indices rather than creating new lists during partitioning for better performance on large datasets due to Python's handling of object references instead of primitive values like integers which can be more costly.",
